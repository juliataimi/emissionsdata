This is a data engineering project by four students in 8/23. 
This repository is mostly written with Python (Pandas, PySpark) and TSQL. 
Data manipulation is performed in three stages; bronze, silver and gold. 
We used Azure Databricks notebooks for data manipulation and Azure Medallion Architecture to create layers of the process. 
Analysis of the data is in the pbix file.
